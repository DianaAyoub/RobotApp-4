# Bonus Homework RobotApp-4

1. Inspect `robot.js` and add comments anywhere you do not fully understand the code. Be as precise as you can in describing what you don't understand. This will give us an idea which subjects to zoom in to in the next lecture. For instance:

    ```js
    // I understand the ternary operation but don't understand what your intention is here
    x = x < board[0].length - 1 ? x + 1 : x;
    ```

2. Carefully examine the `robot.js` render functions and 'reverse engineer' the HTML tags that are created dynamically by adding them manually to the file `static.html`. If all is well opening up `static.html` should look exactly the same as opening up `index.html` (of course, the buttons won't work).

3. Replace all ternary operations (as in the code example above) into equivalent `if-then-else` statements.

### Optional Styling

This is just an optional fun assignment for those of you with graphical design skills. Don't feel obliged to do this if you are as graphically handicapped as I am.

The assignment is to beautify the CSS styling of the game. You should not modify `robot.js` for this (don't add new classes or ids), just modify `style.css`.

I will not review your styling work but we can vote in the next lecture which styling looks best and adapt that for the RobotApp as we go forward.
